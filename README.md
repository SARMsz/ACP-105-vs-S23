<h1>ACP-105 vs S23 – My Brutally Honest Results After Testing Both</h1>

<p>After testing dozens of SARMs, I finally put <strong>ACP-105</strong> and <strong>S23</strong> head-to-head in real cycles. These two are on totally different ends of the spectrum—ACP is often labeled as “mild,” while S23 is considered one of the most <strong>aggressive SARMs ever created</strong>.</p>

<p>This article breaks down my personal results, what each compound did for me, and which one is actually worth your time depending on your goal—<strong>bulking, cutting, or just getting shredded</strong>.</p>

<h2>ACP-105 – Mild But Surprisingly Effective</h2>

<p>I started with <strong>ACP-105</strong> because I wanted something low-suppression and easy on the body. I dosed it at <strong>10mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a recomp phase with maintenance calories. Didn’t expect much—but it honestly overperformed.</p>

<h3>My Results on ACP-105:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clean strength gains by Week 2 (especially on overhead press)</li>
  <li>Noticeable boost in muscle tone without any water retention</li>
  <li>Endurance went up during my HIIT sessions</li>
  <li>No suppression symptoms at all</li>
  <li>Slept great, zero mood swings or irritability</li>
</ul>

<p>It reminded me of a cleaner version of <strong>Ostarine</strong> with a bit more power. Great compound for people who don’t want to mess with PCT or shutdown issues.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Excellent for beginners</li>
  <li>No suppression or side effects</li>
  <li>Nice balance of strength and lean mass</li>
  <li>Great for both men and women</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Not strong enough for bulking</li>
  <li>Results are slower compared to RAD or YK11</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Recomp, Cutting, Endurance</p>

<h2>S23 – Shred City, But With a Price</h2>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is on a totally different level. It’s a <strong>dry, hardening SARM</strong> with serious potential for cutting. I ran it for <strong>6 weeks at 15mg/day</strong> during a deep cut before summer. It did what I expected—and then some.</p>

<h3>My Results on S23:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Extreme fat loss (visible abs by Week 4)</li>
  <li>Vascularity and muscle separation popped</li>
  <li>Libido tanked by Week 5 (common with S23)</li>
  <li>Needed PCT after—strong suppression</li>
  <li>Slept like garbage the last 2 weeks (take melatonin or ZMA)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to get lean and diced, nothing hits like S23. But it’s not for the faint of heart. This stuff <strong>will shut you down</strong> and should be treated more like a steroid than a SARM.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Extreme fat-burning and definition</li>
  <li>Muscle hardness goes up fast</li>
  <li>Great for late-stage cutting cycles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong suppression—needs PCT</li>
  <li>Can affect sleep and mood</li>
  <li>Not for beginners</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Pre-contest, Experienced Users</p>

<h2>ACP-105 vs S23 – What’s the Better SARM?</h2>

<p>These two aren’t even playing the same game. If you want something safe and effective with <strong>no PCT needed</strong>, ACP-105 is a clear choice. If your goal is to get <strong>shredded and dry at all costs</strong>, S23 is the weapon—but be ready to pay the price.</p>

<p>If you’re on the fence: ACP-105 for a safe, clean cycle. S23 if you need a brutal fat loss phase and know what you’re doing.</p>

<h2>My SARM Testing Protocol</h2>

<p>Every SARM I test goes through the same setup:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solo use (no stacking)</li>
  <li>Logged strength and bodyweight daily</li>
  <li>Bloodwork before and after cycle</li>
  <li>Tracked sleep, libido, mood, appetite</li>
</ul>

<p>I keep diet and training consistent to isolate effects. No guesswork, no fake reviews. Just real results from real cycles.</p>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>

<p>If you're going for a clean, side-effect-free recomp, <strong>ACP-105</strong> is the better choice. If you need to get razor-sharp for a photo shoot, competition, or summer, <strong>S23</strong> will carve you up fast—but be ready for the suppression.</p>
